I know, almost everybody knows how to delete instances using lambda functions, but, there are a little difference between a `regular EC2 instance` and `spot instaces`.
In this case, let's say that the `spot instances` are slaves or workers for the `EC2 instances`. 

You would need to use some additional libraries if you want this script works, those libraries are not isntalled by default on AWS, thats why you would need to build this script locally ( on your PC) before push it to AWS.

Those libraries are `pytz` and `datetime`.

I just added a small script that will install those libraries and compress the whole code before push it to AWS.

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash

pip install -t . pytz
pip install -t . datetime
pip install -t . logging
zip -r lamda.zip .

```

As you can se we look for all the spot instances that has been fulfilled ( created and running ), otherwise it will fail with cancelled instances or terminated instances;
also you can tell that we will terminate those `spot intances` that have been working by more than 10h one by one. 

```
import boto3
import logging
from datetime import datetime
from datetime import timedelta
from pytz import timezone
logger = logging.getLogger()
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)




def lambda_handler(event, context):
    client = boto3.client('ec2')
    instances = client.describe_spot_instance_requests(Filters=[{'Name': 'status-code','Values': ['fulfilled']}] )
    est = timezone('<AZ timezone>')
    print est.localize(datetime.now())
    instance=[]
    for r in instances['SpotInstanceRequests']:
        print r['InstanceId']
        print r['Status']['UpdateTime']
        if r["CreateTime"] < est.localize(datetime.now() - timedelta(hours=10)):
            print "Instance Terminated Due more than 10h from creation time"
            instance.append(r['InstanceId'])
            client.terminate_instances( DryRun=False, InstanceIds=instance )
        else:
            print "Instance OK"
    return 1


```
