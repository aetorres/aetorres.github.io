#API Gateway configuration

The goal of this document is to leave the configuration steps to create and connect an API Gateway to Beanstalk private services.

The idea is to have a single access point to our services that are located in our private subnet through the API Gateway

* Network Configuration Steps

    * Create a VPC with 2 subnets (One public and one private)
    * Create a NAT Gateway, attach the public subnet and create a new Elastic IP.
    * Configure or create a new Route Table for private subnet.
      * Create the route table and attach it to the VPC
      * Edit the route tables adding `0.0.0.0/0` as destination and choose the NAT Gateway as Target
    * Create the security groups for each subnet.

* Beanstalk Configuration Steps
  * Create the Beanstalk environment and configure this:
    * Configure Network and choose your VPC and private subnet.
    * Configure Security and add your Key Pair
    * Configure Instances and choose the private security group that you have created.
    * Configure Capacity and choose an `Load Balanced`  Environment
    * Configure Load Balancer and choose a Network Load Balancer, add a listener port (443) and a Processes port (443).
    * On Rolling Update deployment choose `Inmutable` as Rolling Update Type.

* API Gateway Configuration
  * Once you have created your API Gateway, you need to createa VPC Link to connect your API Gateway to your Private Beanstalk
    * Change the Target NLB to the NLB created at the Beanstalk configuration
    * Create a Custom Domain Name (The URL created is the one we are going to register in Route53)
    * Create a stage for your API Gateway and add a Stage Variable that will target the VPC Link ID `vpcLinkId`
    * Choose Use Proxy Integration.
    * Change the resources (GET, POST, etc) and on Integration Request change the Integration Type to `VPC Link` on VPC Link choose *Use Stage Variables* and add the vpc Link variable `${stageVariables.vpcLinkId}`
    * Change the Endpoint to the Custom Domain Name created or the one you choose, this will be used to set the Host header of the integration request.

* Register the new URL on Route 53
  * Go to your hosted zone and create the new record on Route 53 with the *Target Domain Name* from Custom Domain Name as Target
